## Quick Setup
1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jothi-prasath/bash-scripts.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the script's directory:
    ```bash
    cd bash-scripts
    ```
3. Symbolic link all the scripts into your system:
    ```bash
    sudo ./linker.sh
    ```
    The linker.sh script creates symbolic links from the current folder's scripts to the /usr/local/bin directory, allowing you to execute the scripts from anywhere in the terminal by simply typing their names. This method enables easy upgrades using git pull in the future.

## Manual Setup

4. (optional) If you want you can directly copy these scripts to your system

    ```
    After completing this steps, you should be able to execute the scripts from anywhere in the terminal by simply typing their names.

    Please make sure to read the comments within the script file for any additional requirements or instructions specific to that script.

## Dependency
Some of the scripts in this repository may have dependencies on external tools or packages. Before running these scripts, make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed on your system. The specific dependencies required for each script can be found within the individual script files themselves.

In future I will try to make these scripts to auto install the required dependencies when needed.
